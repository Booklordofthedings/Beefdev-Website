                This website explains the ways you can install the <a href="https://www.beeflang.org/">Beef programming language</a> on your systems and also contains some further new user help.
            </p>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <h4>Prebuild</h4>
                Download the latest nightly or full version from the <a href="https://www.beeflang.org/">beef website</a>.
                Downloading the nightly is currently recommended as the nightly contains major bugfixes that are not available in the newest release.
                This will also install the beef ide which is currently only available on windows.
                <br> - <a href="https://nightly.beeflang.org/BeefSetup.exe">Newest Nightly</a>
                <br> - <a href="https://www.beeflang.org/setup/BeefSetup_0_43_4.exe">0.43.4</a>
            <h4>From source</h4>
                Install the requirements listed on the <a href="https://www.beeflang.org/docs/getting-start/building/">beef website</a> and follow the steps, mainly running the install script.
            
            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <h4>Prebuild</h4>
            The currently most official thing you can get rn is the .deb package for BeefBuild maintained by me.
            The apt repository is hosted at <a href="https://beefinstall.com/Repo/">https://beefinstall.com/Repo/</a>.
            Scripts for registering this repository or even building beef or a apt repository yourself are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Booklordofthedings/Beefdev-Utils">Github</a>. <br>
            <code>wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Booklordofthedings/Beefdev-Utils/main/InstallAptFromKey.sh | bash</code> <br>
            <code>apt install beefbuild</code> <br>
            <h4>Build from source</h4>
            Install the requirements listed on the <a href="https://www.beeflang.org/docs/getting-start/building/">beef website</a> and follow the steps, mainly running the install script.
